# Accessibility Project

This project is a fully responsive and accessible website designed to provide an in-depth exploration of the word "accessibility." It includes definitions, historical context, etymology, and related terms, ensuring a comprehensive and informative user experience.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive**: The website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including desktop (1600px), netbook (1024px), tablet (768px), and smartphone (320px).
- **Accessibility-Focused**: Designed with web accessibility principles in mind, ensuring usability for individuals with disabilities.
- **Optimized Navigation**: Includes a responsive navbar and a mobile-friendly menu for easy navigation.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave to ensure consistent performance.
- **Structured Content**: Alternating background colors for sections enhance readability and content differentiation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the core structure, styling, and interactivity
- **Flexbox & Grid** for a flexible and modern layout
- **Semantic HTML** to enhance accessibility and improve SEO

## Accessibility Considerations

- Proper use of semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.).
- ARIA attributes where necessary to enhance screen reader compatibility.
- Sufficient color contrast for readability.
- Keyboard navigability and focus states for interactive elements.
